# Examples

Here you will find some example repositories linked by dependencies defined in a YAML file at the root of each repository.

Here a little representation of the dependecies between projects :

```
Repo-A -> Repo-B, Repo-C
Repo-B -> Repo-C
```

The goal is to update childs project when the origin got a new release.
